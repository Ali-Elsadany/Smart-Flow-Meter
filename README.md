# ðŸ“± Smart Flow Meter

Smart Flow Meter is an Android application that connects to an Arduino device via **Bluetooth** and enables two-way communication 
using the **UART protocol**. The app allows you to both receive real-time data from the Arduino and send data or commands back to it.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”— Bluetooth connectivity with Arduino
- ðŸ“¥ Receive real-time data from Arduino via UART
- ðŸ“¤ Send commands/data to Arduino
- ðŸ“Š Clean and simple user interface
- ðŸ›  Built with Kotlin and XML

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** â€“ Main programming language
- **XML** â€“ Layout and UI design
- **BluetoothAdapter & BluetoothSocket** â€“ Android Bluetooth APIs
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** â€“ Communication protocol

## ðŸ”Œ How It Works

1. Open the Smart Flow Meter app.
2. Pair your Android device with the Arduino over Bluetooth.
3. The app will start receiving data from the Arduino.
4. You can also send data back to the Arduino via the app's interface.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Elsadany/Smart-Flow-Meter
